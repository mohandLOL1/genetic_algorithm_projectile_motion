This project implements a **genetic algorithm (GA) in C** to optimize projectile motion trajectories.  
The algorithm was later extended in **Python** for visualization and analysis.

## Features
- Written in C for efficiency and full control of algorithm mechanics
- Custom fitness evaluation for projectile optimization
- Python visualization to explore trajectory outcomes
- Easily adaptable for other optimization problems

## Example Visualization

## Skills Demonstrated
- C programming & low-level algorithm design
- Python scripting & visualization
- Evolutionary computation and numerical optimization
- Problem solving and project structuring

## Future Work
- Extend GA framework to other physics/engineering optimization problems
- Improve visualization with interactive plots
